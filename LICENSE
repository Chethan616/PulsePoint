                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can use it for
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
developers' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked in
ways different from the original version, so that their problems will
not be attributed erroneously to the authors of the original version.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'
freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse
occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely
where the most acceptability for those freedoms is needed. Therefore,
we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for
those products. If such devices are manufactured, the best way to extend
their usefulness is to read the actual source code from a nonprofit
organization that distributes free software. If you cannot do that, or
if you prefer, you can copy the same software from a copy you procured,
with the permission of the licensor of that copy. (This paragraph does
not affect the legal status of any work as a "free" work under Section 2
of the GPL.)

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software
on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid
the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it
effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents
cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for copyright
infringement, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private
copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user
that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a clear
item in the list would suffice.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For a covered work, this includes all the
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the executable work.

The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code and to
modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,
it does not include System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or
generally available free programs which are used unmodified in running
the work but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
Source includes interface definition files associated with source files,
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms
and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.

You may make, run and propagate verbatim copies of the Program's source
code, as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
and a notice stating that this License and the disclaimer of warranty
apply to this Program. You may not impose any further restrictions on
the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For
example, you may not impose a "per-seat" license fee for the privilege of
running the Program. You may cause modified source versions of the Program
to be covered by this License.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the
WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws
prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License, and you disclaim any
intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights
to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and a notice stating
that this License and the disclaimer of warranty apply to the Program,
keep intact all the notices of this License and give any recipients a
copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of Section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under Section 7. This
requirement modifies the requirement in Section 4 to "keep intact all
the notices".

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
apply, along with any applicable Section 7 additional terms, to the whole
which is made of up the Program, and modified parts. The License will not
allow any other permission beyond the scope of this License.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which
are not combined with it such to form a larger program, in or on a volume
of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate". An
aggregate does not include a compilation of a covered work with works
licensed under the terms of Section 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.

A work forms part of an aggregate if and only if it is included in or
compiled with a covered work in such a way that the copyright resulting
from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of
a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to
the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
Sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the Corresponding Source
by one of the following methods:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone
who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding
Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this
License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software
interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed
only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the
object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a fee), and offer access to the Corresponding Source from
the same place at the same time--unless you (or the relevant third party)
have not been obliged to convey the Corresponding Source. If the object
code is to be conveyed at a designated place, conveying the Corresponding
Source from a conveniently close place, independent of the designated
place, is considered to be conveying the Corresponding Source from the
same place and at the same time.

e) Receive a copy of the object code from a distinguished recipient and
convey it as part of a photographic album containing at least one other
covered work, or as part of a collection of at least one other covered
work, provided that you give the same offer to provide the Corresponding
Source to all recipients of the entire photographic album or collection.

f) Convey the object code in a way that requires these terms to be met,
such as a peer-to-peer transmission, and accompany the object code with
the Corresponding Source. A Corresponding Source conveyed in a peer-to-
peer transmission must be made available to all peers at no charge
throughout the duration of the transmission.

For object code in a transparent file format, Corresponding Source need
not appear in any file that is transparent to users, but in a separate
file. A file format is "transparent" if it is a format readily readable
and parseable by humans, without needing any special tool, by contrast
with an opaque format designed only to be read and parsed by programs,
or designed to output data only after being interpreted by programs. A
file format that would otherwise be transparent is opaque if used to
encode data or instructions in a way that prevents or hinders users from
making modifications to the work.

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. A "transparent" file format is a format readily
readable and parseable by humans, without needing any special tool, by
contrast with an "opaque" format designed only to be read and parsed by
programs, or designed only to output data after being interpreted by
programs.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
by making exceptions to one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are
valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part
of the Program, that part may be used accordingly, provided the whole
remains governed by this License in accordance with Section 10.

An "excluded provision" is any requirement imposed by a licensee, such as
a condition of settlement of a lawsuit, that conditions exercise of
rights under this License with payment of a royalty or license fee or
demands that the work be proprietary or otherwise limit the users'
freedom to exercise rights under this License. An excluded provision
cannot be incorporated into a permissive license.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7, you may place additional
permissions on material added by you to a covered work, for which you have
or can obtain appropriate copyright permission. These additional permissions
must be compatible with this License, meaning that the additional
permissions must not contradict the terms of this License. For example,
you may place a waiver of warranty on material added by you, provided the
waiver does not disclaim the warranty of the Program as a whole.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
(including any patent licenses granted under the first paragraph of Section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless the copyright holder has terminated your license by giving you
reasonable written notice to do so, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior
to 60 days after you cease violation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under Section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
copy does not require acceptance of this License. However, nothing other
than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so with all its terms and conditions.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all of the assets of one, or subdividing
an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to the transaction
who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the
work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the
previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding
Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor
has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
"per-seat" license fee for the privilege of running the Program. You may
cause modified source versions of the Program to be covered by this
License.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.

The patent licenses granted in this License are for the Program's entire
scope, and apply to the Program and works based on it.

A "contributed version" is the contributor's version of the Program as
modified by the contributor.

The "patent claims" of a contributor are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner of making, using, or
selling the contributed version, but excluding claims that would be
infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributed
version.

For purposes of this License, "essential patent claims" are any patent
claims, owned or controlled by the contributor, that would be infringed by
some manner of making, using, or selling the contributed version, but do
not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the contributed version.

A licensee exercising rights under this License will not be liable for
infringement of any patent claims held by the contributor, provided that
the licensee does not initiate patent litigation against the contributor.

If you institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
or a contributed version of it constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to you under this
License for that Program shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for conveying from those to whom you convey the
Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License
is to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of
the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to
convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to
apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special provisions of
the GNU Affero General Public License, Section 13, concerning interaction
through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement
of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version
for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
holder as a result of choosing a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
return for a fee.

                           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software that everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

 To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
 attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
 the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full license text is found.

    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does not have interactive user interfaces, a "mouse" interface
or similar, your program's user interface should display the "Appropriate
Legal Notices".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For
more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your software is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead of this License; but first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html>.
